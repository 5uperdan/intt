<h2>intt</h2>
<p>intt provides a simple API for tokenising (Java) identifier names. There are 
two main API classes: a factory and a tokeniser. The factory is used to configure and 
create instances of a tokeniser. The tokeniser does the work.</p>

<p>Refer to the README.md for details of licensing and details of the research 
    paper that describes the techniques implemented in intt, and the 
    bibliographic details needed to cite intt when using it as part of a 
    research project.</p>
